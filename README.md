# readTablesFromOldAccess_MDB_inR

This R script was created to read results from the microsoft access mdb created by the genetic analysis program MolKin (Guiterez et.al 2005). Recent versions of acces cannot read the file directly.  This process uses R and ODBC drivers to enable extraction of all the database tables to .csv files without the need of MS Access.

It should also work for exporting other 32- bit access .mdb tables to .csv.
